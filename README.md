# 🎮 Guess My Number

> A fun, interactive number guessing game I coded from scratch in vanilla JavaScript, inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s course — to learn DOM manipulation, state handling, and game logic.

## 🕹️ What it does

- Generates a random secret number between 1 and 20.
- allows the player to guess and see immediate feedback:
  - “Too high” / “Too low” / “Correct!”
- Keeps track of the player’s current score.
- Updates and stores the highest score so you can beat your best.
- Reset button to play again instantly.

All interactions update the UI live, and the secret number reveals when you guess correctly.
